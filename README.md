<h3 align="center">Welcome to my Portfolio Project Page</h3>

- I built this page using HTML and CSS

- I am new to coding, so my projects are limited. Please note projects are not 100% complted by myself and were generated works from the coding bootcamp.

## To help build this page, I incorproated the lessons learned in:

- CSS-color
- CSS-units-fonts
- CSS-selectors
- CSS-box-model
- CSS-box-positioning
- Flexbox-Layout
- Responsive-Design
- Flexbox-Placement
- Box-Styling
- Media-Query-Screen
- and more...

## This Module Required the following:
- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
